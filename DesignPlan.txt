1. The first thing is an Object called "Data". In it, there are several attributes that dictate the program. The first
one listed is "gameActive". "gameActive" is set to true as long as the player doesn't guess incorrectly. When
"gameActive" is set to false, the game stops. Second is "round". "round" does two things; first, it is incremented by
1 every time the player progress in each round. And secondly, at the beginning of loading each new screen, it is
 multiplied by 5 which then becomes the new number for "facesOnScreen". "facesOnScreen" is used by function to generate
  the desired number of smiley faces on screen for each consecutive round.

2. We then have two functions. One is generateRandomPosition(), which is used to generate the position each face occupies
on screen. Then we have generateCorrectNumber() which generates a random number based the number in Data.facesOnScreen.

3. The third is an Object aptly names LinkedList. In the code, LinkedList is empty. However, in the next line of code,
we have populateLinkedList(). The function creates a linked list of objects based on the number of Data.facesOnScreen.
Each node in the list is given an attribute called "numberId" which is the index in the while loop that generates the
LinkedList. Each Node is given an attribute called "isCorrect" which are all set to Boolean false at first. And each are
given two attributes that determines positioning; one called "LeftRight" and the other is called "top", both are
generated generateRandomPosition().

4. Then after that we must immediatley run a function called assignCorrect(). This goes through LinkedList that was just
populated and takes the generateCorrectNumber, and changes the "isCorrect" attribute to true of the object whose numberId
is the same as the product of generateCorrectNumber.

(It may be better to just incorporate assignCorrect into populateLinkedList())

....So I think when you do the DOM thing, you should first get all the faces that have "isCorrect: false" first, then
have a function that puts the one with "isCorrect: true". This is so that the one the player has to click isn't buried
beneath all the other ones.
